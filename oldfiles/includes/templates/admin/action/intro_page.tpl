<strong>Things to remember:</strong><br /><br />
<u>Editing a page:</u><br />
When editing a page, it is important to note that if you modify the link name associated with this page, then the url will also change hence old links to this page will not work. Therefore you will need to change manually those to the new link. <br />
<br />
<u>Page link:</u><br />
Each page is associated to a link, the link is based on the link name which is crucial for SEO purposes and search rankings. To find out the link of a page, you can either navigate to that page or find it through the Index Page (Sitemap) in the Administration Menu.<br />
<br />
<u>Moving a page:</u><br />
It is not recommended to move a page, since moving a page will also affect all the subpages therefore all the urls of those pages will also be modified!<br />
<br />
<strong>CAUTION: For security reasons, you will be automatically disconnected if you are inactive for more than 15 minutes, make sure you save frequently while you are editing your text!</strong>
